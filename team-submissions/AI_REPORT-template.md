> **Note to Students:** > The questions and examples provided in the specific sections below are **prompts to guide your thinking**, not a rigid checklist. 
> * **Adaptability:** If a specific question doesn't fit your strategy, you may skip or adapt it.
> * **Depth:** You are encouraged to go beyond these examples. If there are other critical technical details relevant to your specific approach, please include them.
> * **Goal:** The objective is to convince the reader that you have employed AI agents in a thoughtful way.

**Required Sections:**

1. **The Workflow:** How did you organize your AI agents? (e.g., "We used a Cursor agent for coding and a separate ChatGPT instance for documentation").
2. **Verification Strategy:** How did you validate code created by AI?
* *Requirement:* You must describe specific **Unit Tests** you wrote to catch AI hallucinations or logic errors.


3. **The "Vibe" Log:**
* *Win:* One instance where AI saved you hours.
* *Learn:* One instance where you altered your prompting strategy (provided context, created a skills.md file, etc) to get better results from your interaction with the AI agent.
* *Fail:* One instance where AI failed/hallucinated, and how you fixed it.
* *Context Dump:* Share any prompts, `skills.md` files, MCP etc. that demonstrate thoughtful prompting.
